# LOVE-WrapLua

A small and simple LOVE2D wrapper for OneLua, lpp-vita, and Lua Player PS3

You can use this to make LOVE2D stuff for a PSP, PS Vita, and/or PS3! As an example, this is used on [DDLC-LOVE](https://github.com/LukeZGD/DDLC-LOVE/)

This is made just for fun and will only have the basic stuff.

- See `Implemented.md` for the list of implemented stuff
- `script.lua` is the main file for LOVE-WrapLua (required)
- `index.lua` is for lpp-vita to run `script.lua` (required for lpp-vita only)
- `app.lua` is for Lua Player PS3 to run `script.lua` (required for Lua Player PS3 only)
- `lv1luaconf` in `conf.lua` is to set up some settings for key configuration `keyconf`, resolution scale `resscale`, and image scale `imgscale`. This is optional; See `script.lua` for the default values
